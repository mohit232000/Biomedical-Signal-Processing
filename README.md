# Biomedical-Signal-Processing

The aim of the project was to gain a deeper understanding of how ECG signals are generated and the different methods used to filter noise. Using MATLAB, I simulated and generated ECG signals, then applied different filtering techniques such as Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) filter, Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter, and Wavelet Transform to remove the noise from the generated signals. To evaluate the performance of each filter, I compared their results based on metrics such as signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and the percentage of noise removed.
